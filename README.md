## Introduction
“The Immortal Billy” is a text-based rogue-like game consisting of 4 regions, each characterized by earth, fire, water, and air, respectively. In total, 34 rooms exist. There are seven rooms per region, one mini-boss room per region, and one culminating boss room. As a player advances, they must overcome puzzles and monsters that progressively become more difficult. The game's objective is to successfully reach and defeat the boss room. To do so, the player must navigate through randomly generated dungeon rooms and collect 4 keys. Players respawns are permitted, and the player will begin again in the 'Central Hub' if they are defeated in battle. Acquired items in the player inventory, spells, and player stats will be persistently saved.
