## Introduction
“The Immortal Billy” is a text-based rogue-like game consisting of 4 regions, each characterized by earth, fire, water, and air, respectively. In total, 34 rooms exist. There are seven rooms per region, one mini-boss room per region, and one culminating boss room. As a player advances, they must overcome puzzles and monsters that progressively become more difficult. The game's objective is to successfully reach and defeat the boss room. To do so, the player must navigate through randomly generated dungeon rooms and collect 4 keys. Players respawns are permitted, and the player will begin again in the 'Central Hub' if they are defeated in battle. Acquired items in the player inventory, spells, and player stats will be persistently saved.

### Central Hub
This is the central room of the dungeon where the player begins. They are prompted with options regarding which of the Elemental Districts they want to traverse to. After clearing the districts, the player can return to the _Central Hub_ and use the Keys they loot in order to unlock the gate to the Elemental Throne Room. If the character dies at any point of time, they will respawn in the _Central Hub_, but retain their inventories and progress.
* NORTH - Fire District
* SOUTH - Earth District
* EAST - Water District
* WEST - Air District
* UP - Throne Room of the Elementals

Besides the Central Hub where the player is prompted with entering any one of the four cardinal directions, the only way to navigate through the game map is by typing FORWARD or BACKWARD.
